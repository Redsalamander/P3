The 3D one 3D Prnter is based on my experiences build 3D printers.
The Printer is a complete unit as desinged and build by me. 

I set you to design and build a 3D Printer in less than a week. This is what I managed to acheive in 6 days. 
I started with a frame as seen in pictures and built it around this with the knowledge that the 19mm tube I speced it on
can be hard to come by. 25mm tube is muc more common and I build it so that I could adjust it to the biger size.

While building it with this in mind a greater priority was to acheive the best use of space and have a platform that can
scale easily. In this case the length of tubing and bearing on the same axiz is all that need to be increaded to build a bigger ar if for some reason smaller printer.

You can for instance build a printer that prints 20x20mm but 400mm high by increasing the Z shafts and tubes by about 300m
My big printer that I printed all the parts for this printer on is based on the same framework but in 25mm and has a 
build volume of 300x400x540mm That's big enough so that I could print a engine cover as one part. 

The printer license is as follows. 
You may print it for personal use but cannot commercially sell it, parts or derivatives without agreement from myself.
